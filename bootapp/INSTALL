Pre-requisites: 
	1) a working internet connection
	2) ability to reach cpan.org from this machine
	3) perl language installed

If you must run this disconnected, please open an issue on the issue tracker.



1st: Create directories, users, groups as needed.  Do not run as root or
     a priveledged user/group.

     Details are left to the reader, though we recommend

	run directory = /data/tiburon/bootapp
	user	      = www-data
	group	      = www-data

     You can check the existence of these user/group with

	getent passwd | grep 'www-data'
	getent group  | grep 'www-data'

     You can create the directory with

	sudo mkdir -p /data/tiburon/bootapp

     and then move all the needed files into that location

	sudo cp -rv boot.pl root/ /data/tiburon/bootapp

     and set the ownership to www-data

	sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /data/tiburon/bootapp


2nd: install perl modules.  You may need to do this as admin user

	sudo ./install_perl_mods.pl

     This will install all the needed perl modules for you from the public 
     CPAN repositories.


3rd:  test the boot.pl app

	
	perl -c /data/tiburon/bootapp/boot.pl

     change the path as needed to reflect where you moved it.  If
     any modules are missing, you will get messages to that effect.
     If you have all the modules you need then it will respond

	/data/tiburon/bootapp/boot.pl syntax OK


4th:  configure the service

	sudo ./configure_boot_service.pl \
		-b /data/tiburon/bootapp/boot.pl 	\
		-r /data/tiburon/bootapp/		\
		-svc tiburon_boot.service		\
		-sdp /etc/systemd/system

      This will generate the service file for you at 
      /etc/systemd/system/tiburon_boot.service.  We would recommend editing
      that file to add any command line options you wish.

      Then you will need to enable that service

	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable tiburon_boot.service

      You can start the service to make sure it loads correctly.

	sudo systemctl start tiburon_boot.service
